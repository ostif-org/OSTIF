In 2026, another iteration of the Managed Audit Program is being offered. A list of possible projects to consider for security audit engagements is provided upon request. Funding organizations can either choose projects from this list, or add their own projects commensurate with funding contribution. OSTIF then follows a security audit process. Results are aggregated annualy and attributed to funders.

The Managed Audit Program is an effective way for organizations to improve the security posture of critical open source projects. Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc has over 10 years of experience and an open track record of successful security engagements for open source projects of all types. 

Step 1: Provisional Approval: Thumbs up to a project or group of projects.
  Action Item once approved: Reach out to maintainer(s)/community		

Step 2: Second-Level Approval: Once a project is onboard, work with them to get final scope and budgets.				

Step 3: Process Statement of Work and Fund Audit Work

Result: Exponential scale in finding and fixing of bugs and vulnerabilities, supply chain threat mitigation, custom security tooling suites and threat models to continually help projects.
