In 2026, another iteration of the Managed Audit Program is being offered. A list of possible projects to consider for security audit engagements is provided upon request. Funding organizations can either choose projects from this list, or add their own projects commensurate with funding contribution. OSTIF then follows a security audit process. Results are aggregated annualy and attributed to funders.

The Managed Audit Program is an effective way for organizations to improve the security posture of critical open source projects. Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc has over 10 years of experience and an open track record of successful security engagements for open source projects of all types. 

Step 1: Provisional Approval: Thumbs up to a project or group of projects.
  Action Item once approved: Reach out to maintainer(s)/community		

Step 2: Second-Level Approval: Once a project is onboard, work with them to get final scope and budgets.				

Step 3: Process Statement of Work and Fund Audit Work

Result: Exponential scale in finding and fixing of bugs and vulnerabilities, supply chain threat mitigation, custom security tooling suites and threat models to continually help projects. 		
							
Step by Step Process:

1. Select Relevant Projects for Independent Review

Data from multiple sources: Census Studies/Academic Research/Indepdendent Research/Community Feedback/ecosystems data

Considering the dependency trees of leading projects

Eliminating projects that already have help

Eliminating projects that don’t significantly impact security

2. Community/Maintainer Participation

Reach out to project maintianer(s), community, foundation, etc. 

Socialize audit process and onboard projects. 

3. Scope Auditing Appropriately

Consider only areas of code that impact security

Do not repeat the works of others

Time audits to cover major releases and updates

Break large projects into smaller parts to avoid fatigue

4. Scope Audit, Build Statement of Work, Secure Funding

5. Select the Best Audit Teams

Competitive bidding system to keep costs down and quality up.

Only consider highly qualified individuals with the skills to review the specific project in the proposal

Only consider teams that are willing to work in public view

 6. Conduct the Audits

Work with the lead developers to set up a secure channel for reporting serious bugs

Issues are reported as they are found, not in bulk

Fixes are suggested by the security team if appropriate

  7. Squash All of the Bugs

Wait for security fixes to be applied before publishing (Maximum 90 days unless there are special circumstances)

Security team and lead developers work together to find complete solutions

All severe bugs are reported as CVEs to the relevant CNAs The Project Selection Process

  8. Publish All Results

Results published with attribution to funders, along with a synopsis and results of the audit.

Coordinated publishing between all parties when applicable
