Between 2021 and 2025, Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) collectively managed audit programs for over 20 funding sources. As a result, over 100 security audits were completed, resulting in significant uplift to critical open source projects. This collective body of work serves as evidence of effectiveness of OSTIF and the organization's ability to ingest funding and produce positive security outcomes for open source projects. 

In 2026, another iteration of the Managed Audit Program is being offered. A list of possible projects to consider for security audit engagements is provided. Funding organizations can either choose projects from this list, or add their own projects commensurate with funding contribution. OSTIF then follows a security audit process. Results are aggregated annualy and attributed to funders.
