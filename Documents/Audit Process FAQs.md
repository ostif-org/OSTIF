## What is the process of an audit?
Depending on the project, after an initial meeting to gauge needs of the Project Representatives, a unique RFP (Request For Proposals) is built and submitted to trusted teams for them to build a proposal. Once a proposal is accepted, the Audit Team and Project Representatives will have a kickoff meeting to nail out details and begin the audit. Once the security audit is complete, the Audit Team will write and submit a report for publication with all parties involved. Once published, the project is considered complete. 

## How long does an audit take to complete?
It fluctuates. Depending on the scope and teams involved, audit steps can take between 2-4 weeks, with additional time for the security audit itself. 

## What is the time commitment involved?
OSTIF understands and respects individual needs and personal time. We aim to make this process as invasive as possible, with no added burden on the Project Representatives. That said, audits where the two teams work together and communicate well are highly successful and garner results that eclipse the audits that lack that teamwork. 

## What deliverables are to be expected?
At the end of the audit, a published report of all inconsistencies and their recommended patches and remediation will be available to all parties and the public. Any testing artifacts are the projects to keep and use in perpetuity. 

## How do you choose the audit team? Does the project have any say in the choice? 
Audit teams are chosen through a RFP process that is scored on a scale. The proposal with the most points is then accepted as the winning bid. Should a project wish to see the RFP before it is dispersed, that is allowed. Input to the RFP by the project is allowed, so long as it does not affect the necessary information for the bidders.

## How will you communicate vulnerabilities? On what timeline?
OSTIF follows Googleâ€™s Project Zero Standard of 90 days to report vulnerabilities to the public. We understand the pressing nature of critical finds, and critical/high findings are communicated ASAP to the project through the chosen communication channels. This is to allow the project as much time as possible to remediate or fix these vulnerabilities before publication.

## What is the publishing timeline? What is the process?
Publication of the final report happens once the project, audit team, and OSTIF are in agreement to a date, time and final status of the audit. A Coordinated Publishing Guide is shared among all parties to allow transparency of verbiage, message, and statements. This allows all interested parties time and access to all public communication about the security audit. 

## Why do we publish?
As a third party open source non profit organization, OSTIF works transparently. We believe our work should be shared with the community for growth, knowledge, and awareness of the security of the projects they use.
